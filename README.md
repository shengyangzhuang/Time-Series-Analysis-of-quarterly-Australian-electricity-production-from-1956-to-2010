# Time-Series-Analysis-of-quarterly-Australian-electricity-production-from-1956-to-2010

A time series is a sequence of random samples with a (non-trivial) dependence on time. They arise in everything from economical sciences to engineering and natural sciences. As a result, methods for analyzing such time series have applications in a wide range of fields. Time Series Analysis is a course that gives students a broad introduction to basic concepts, models, and solution methods in the field of time series analysis. This course is of a mathematical nature and emphasizes the underlying theory, but also includes applications to real-life time series.

This is a project assignment of the course Time Series Analysis supervised by Dr. Guo-Jhen Wu from School of Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

This report aims to fit a stationary time series model to a data set of quarterly Australian electricity production ranging from 1956 to 2010. The production volume is given in kWh. The analysis will be conducted in RStudio, which is a software used for statistical analysis. The source of the data comes from key2stats data set.
